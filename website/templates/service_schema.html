Perfect 👍 Let’s do this clean, SEO-strong, and Google-friendly.
Below are 4 separate Service Schemas — one for each service.
You can paste all of them together inside the <head> section of your website (or specific service pages).
I’ve written them in a generic but powerful way, so they rank well and don’t look spammy.

    "url": "https://yourwebsite.com"
